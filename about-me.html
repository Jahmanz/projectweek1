Well, you'll have to look at my life experiences to understand this. I grew up in San Francisco but did my undergrad in Washington. After my undergraduate at <span style="color: red">Washington State University</span>, moved back to SF and began my career that would last more than 10 years in sales, tech support, customer support, and account management, even when I moved to Seattle a couple years ago.  Some of my places of employment are not even listed on my resume because it would take another page!  The common conclusion from many of these position was getting laid off because the struggles of the given company.  Each time, people in my position were the first to go.  ANd everytime, the developers were the last to go.  So the most recent layoff, it took me a while to realize I need to know this stuff.  <strong>I'm tired of being expendable.</strong>  So I'm rolling the dices and betting on myself.  I'm looking towards my future, and believe learning to code will be a huge part of that. Please checkout my resume below. </p></h4></center></div></div>
